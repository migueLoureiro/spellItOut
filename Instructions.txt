Constraints
·         Please don’t spend a lot of time on setting up procedures to read the input or display the output. For our purposes a method which accepts the input would suffice

·         Follow clean code / SOLID principles and stay as close as possible to object oriented programming. Name variables, methods, functions appropriately. Refactor when necessary.

·         Avoid static, utils or helper classes

·         Make reasonable assumptions and document it as a README.md
